HAL 9000 Windows Optimization Script
Overview
This script is designed to clean and optimize a Windows system in a fun and engaging way by simulating interactions between HAL 9000 (from 2001: A Space Odyssey) and Dave, the protagonist. The script performs common maintenance tasks such as cleaning temporary files, optimizing drives, and checking for system integrity, while HAL and Dave exchange dialogue throughout the process.

Features
Temporary File Cleanup: Removes unnecessary files from Windows temp folders, user profile temp folders, and various app caches.
DNS Cache Clearing: Clears the DNS cache to improve network efficiency.
Windows Update Cleanup: Removes old Windows Update files to free up space.
Windows Update Check: Checks for and installs any available Windows updates.
Drive Optimization: Analyzes and optimizes SSDs and HDDs (TRIM for SSDs, Defrag for HDDs).
System File Check (SFC): Scans and repairs corrupt system files.
Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM): Repairs Windows component store corruption.
HAL & Dave Interaction: HAL introduces himself, provides updates on the system, and interacts with Dave, who helps manage the process.
Daisy Song: If the system is restarted, HAL sings the iconic "Daisy Bell" song during shutdown, adding a nostalgic element.

Requirements
Windows PowerShell
System running Windows 10/11
Administrator privileges to perform optimization tasks

Installation
Run the script in PowerShell with administrator privileges:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\HAL_Windows_Optimization.ps1

Usage
Introduction: The script starts with an introduction from HAL and Dave. They will provide details about the system and the maintenance tasks they plan to perform.

Maintenance Tasks: The script will then begin cleaning temporary files, optimizing drives, and checking system integrity, while HAL and Dave comment on each step.

Restart Option: After completing all tasks, HAL will recommend restarting the system to apply changes. If the user chooses to restart, HAL will shut down with a "Daisy Bell" performance.

Customization
You can modify the following aspects of the script:

Temporary File Paths: Add or remove file paths to customize which temporary files and caches are deleted.
Optimization Steps: You can enable or disable certain steps, such as disk cleanup, by commenting out or editing the respective function calls.
